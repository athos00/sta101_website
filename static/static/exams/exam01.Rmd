## Rules

-   This is an individual assignment.
-   You may not collaborate or communicate anything about this exam to
    **anyone** except the instructor. For example, you may not
    communicate with other students, the TAs, or post/solicit help on
    the internet, email or via any other method of communication.
-   You may use `R`, as well as any notes, books, or existing internet
    resources to answer exam questions. If you use a resource outside of those
    we used for class, you should cite it.
-   You must cite any code you use as inspiration. A failure to cite is
    plagiarism. Cite any sources by providing a link to the original
    source in your exam write-up.
-   Do not email the TAs with questions.
-   If you have questions email the instructor or message in slack. Questions should only be
    about understanding the data or the examâ€™s instructions. You may not
    ask questions on any topics from past assignments or material
    related to the exam.
-   The instructor will provide code debugging if needed, but this will
    result in a **grade penalty**. Note: ask questions early. Questions asked between 6:00pm and 11:59pm Monday the 11th may not be answered. 
    
With the exception of **major emergencies**, late submissions will not be accepted. In the case of a major emergency, you should have your Dean send the instructor an excuse. Start and submit the exam early in
order to **avoid any last-minute technical issues.**
