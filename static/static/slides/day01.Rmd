## Why data analysis and statistical inference?

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '75%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/prisonLetter.png")
```

- $26 \times 25 \times 24 \times ... \times 2 \times 1 = 4 \times 10^{26}$ possible combinations

## Why data analysis and statistical inference?

- On January 28 1986 the Challenger space shuttle exploded 73 seconds after takeoff.

- It was determined failed O rings were the cause: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-ring)

- Could the Challenger disaster have been prevented?

## The course website

[sta101.github.io](https://sta101.github.io)

Here you'll find 

- course schedule

- syllabus

- office hours

and three important links: R containers, slack and the book.

Let's take a look...

## Logistics

- Prepare, participate, practice, perform

- Policy: sharing / reusing code

- Course community & learning environment

- Late policy and regrade requests

- Resources

## Logistics

- **Prepare, participate, practice, perform**

  - prepare: watch preparatory videos or read from the book
  - participate in lectures, labs, office hours and slack
  - practice applying concepts on in-class application exercises
  - perform on labs, exams and projects

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '100%'} 
  knitr::include_graphics("img/01/assignments.png")
```

---

## Logistics

- **Policy: sharing / reusing code**

  - you must always cite any code you copy or use as inspiration. Copied code without citation is plagiarism and will result in a 0 for the assignment

  - copying and citing a large amount of code to satisfy a main objective of an assignment will result in a 0 for the assignment

  - carefully read each assignment so you know what is permitted and what is not. If you are ever unsure what is allowed, please ask a member of the teaching team

## Logistics

**Course community & learning environment**


Course community
- Uphold the Duke Community Standard: 
> - I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
>- I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
> - I will act if the Standard is compromised.

Learning environment

  - Respect, honor, and celebrate our diverse community 
  - Learning environment that is welcoming, inclusive, and accessible to everyone

## Logistics

- **Late policy and regrade requests**

  Late policy
  - late work is not accepted
  - to accommodate this strict policy, your lowest lab will be dropped
  - missed lab or exams can only be excused under exceptional circumstances and requires a letter from the Dean
  
  Regrade requests
  - must be submitted within 4 days of when the assignment is returned
