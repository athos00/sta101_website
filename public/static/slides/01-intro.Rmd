# Data Science

---

## What is data science?

--

- Data science is using data to understand the world.

- We're going to learn to do this in a principled and `tidy` way -- more on that later!

- This is a course on introduction to data science, with an emphasis on statistical thinking.

---

## Course FAQ

**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**
A - None.

<br>

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**
A - Not a traditional one. While statistics $\neq$ data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics.

<br>

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**
A - Yes. We will use the computing language R.

---

## Course learning objectives

- Learn to explore, visualize, and analyze data in a *reproducible* and *shareable* manner

- Gain experience in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization

- develop your own question(s) about a data set of your choosing and use statistical techniques to answer the question(s)

- effectively communicate results through written assignments and final project presentation

---

## Some of what you will learn

.pull-left[
- Fundamentals of `R`

- Data visualization and wrangling with `ggplot2` and `dplyr` from the `tidyverse`

- Web based applications with `RShiny`

- Spatial data visualization

]

.pull-right[
- Data types and functions

- Version control with `GitHub`

- Reproducible reports with `R Markdown`

- Regression and classification

- Statistical inference
]

## Examples continued

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '75%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/prisonLetter.png")
```

- $26 \times 25 \times 24 \times ... \times 2 \times 1 = 4 \times 10^{26}$ possible combinations

After you create your account, go to [https://forms.gle/iYLiid39R3ujMbmWA](https://forms.gle/iYLiid39R3ujMbmWA) and enter your Duke email address (NETID@duke.edu) and GitHub username. 

<small>
Some tips from [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice).
</small>

- <small>Incorporate your actual name!</small>
- <small> Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e.<small> g., Twitter or Slack.</small>
- <small> Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.</small>

# Let's look an example!

- Let's look at a [sample roster data exercise](https://sta199-sp22-003.netlify.app/appex/ae01.html).

- After setting up Git in RStudio (either today or in lab next week) you can clone the repo "ae01" here: [https://github.com/sta199-s22](https://github.com/sta199-s22)

- Note: This application exercise does *NOT* need to be turned in!
